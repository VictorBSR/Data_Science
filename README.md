# Projects:
Collection of diverse data science and machine learning projects, mostly in Jupyter Notebooks format.

* **COVID-19 diagnosis prediction / predição de diagnóstico de COVID-19:** based on various features such as comorbidities and hospitalization conditions. This uses classification algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, together with cross validation and hyperparameter optimization.
* **Tweets sentiment analysis / análise de sentimentos de Tweets:** multiclass classification NLP project that classifies whether a tweet is positive, neutral or negative. This uses text preprocessing tools such as lemmatization and Doc2Vec in order to deal with emojis/emoticons, hashtags and other tokens. In the end a Logistic Regression algorithm is preferred and optimized in order to obtain the best results for this kind of short text.
* **IMDB Data Analysis With Pandas:** this is a data analysis/dataviz project in which I perform basic data sorting, discover insights and generate diverse graphs and useful views. In the end I present a simple movie recommendation system based on some features (movie genre, sex, age...) using Python.
* **Wine Quality Prediction using Linear and Logistic Regression:** in this project I explore a famous dataset and develop a classification ML model to predict both the red and white wine quality ratings, using linear and logistic regression.
