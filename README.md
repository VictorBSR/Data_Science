# Projects:
Collection of diverse data science and machine learning projects, mostly in Jupyter Notebooks format.

* **COVID-19 diagnosis prediction / predição de diagnóstico de COVID-19:** based on various features such as comorbidities and hospitalization conditions. This uses classification algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, together with cross validation and hyperparameter optimization.
* **Tweets sentiment analysis / análise de sentimentos de Tweets:** multiclass classification NLP project that classifies whether a tweet is positive, neutral or negative. This uses text preprocessing tools such as lemmatization and Doc2Vec in order to deal with emojis/emoticons, hashtags and other tokens. In the end a Logistic Regression algorithm is preferred and optimized in order to obtain the best results for this kind of short text.
